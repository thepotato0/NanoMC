NanoMC is basically **Minecraft 1.8.9 but tiny and portable**.  
It’s less than **300MB**, runs from a USB stick, and doesn’t need any setup.  
Perfect if you just want to hop into 1.8.9 PvP anywhere without waiting for installs.

## ✨ Why NanoMC?
- Runs straight from a folder or USB – no installer, no launcher mess.
- Comes with its own Java, so you don’t need to install it separately.
- Slimmed down to under 300MB (vanilla 1.8.9 is bloated compared to this).
- Just works™ – double-click and play.

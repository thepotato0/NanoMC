## [?] What is NanoMC?
NanoMC is a **portable, no-install build of Minecraft 1.8.9**.  
It packs everything into a folder less than **300MB**, runs from anywhere, and doesn’t require Java or setup.  
Remember, Eaglercraft is NOT native java, it's WebGL! This runs on native java x64!

Basically: *grab it, plug in, double-click, and play.* Perfect if you love **quick PvP sessions on the go.**
